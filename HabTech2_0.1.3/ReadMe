HABTECH 2
A mod for Kerbal Space Program 1.6.1 by Benjee10. 

INSTALLATION
Place the contents of GameData/ into your KSP/GameData/ directory. 
This mod bundles COMMUNITY RESOURCE PACK, BENJEE10_SHAREDASSETS and B9PARTSWITCH, which are distributed under their respective licenses. 

DEPENDENCIES
This mod requires KERBAL INVENTORY SYSTEM as a dependency. 
Plays nice with reDIRECT, Tantares, BlueDog Design Bureau, Cormorant Aeronology, SSPXR and Tundra Exploration. 

FUTURE PLANS
Eventually I plan for every module of the US segment of the ISS (including the truss structure and externally mounted experiments) to be represented.
